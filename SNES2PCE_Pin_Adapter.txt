SNES Port 1:

    ..----------------------------- ---------------------..
    | <1>     <2>     <3>     <4>  |  <5>     <6>     <7>  |
    ``----------------------------- ---------------------``

    Pin 1:	+5v         ->      PCE Controller Port 1:   +5v
    Pin 2:	clock       ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  "CLR"
    Pin 3:	latch       ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  "SEL"
    Pin 4:	data        ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  "D0" (input line)
    Pin 5:  N/A
    Pin 6:  N/A
    Pin 7	  ground      ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  Ground

SNES port 2:

     ..--------------------- ----------------------------..
    | <7>     <6>     <5>  |   <4>    <3>     <2>     <1>  |
     ``--------------------- ----------------------------``

    Pin 1:	+5v         ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  +5v
    Pin 2:	clock       ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  "CLR"
    Pin 3:	latch       ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  "SEL"
    Pin 4:	data        ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  "D1" (input line)
    Pin 5:  N/A
    Pin 6:  N/A
    Pin 7	  ground      ->      PCE Controller Port 1:  Ground


  NOTE
  ====
    
        The PCE controller code drives both SNES controllers (clock and latch).
        Only difference is D0 and D1.



  PCE connector
  =============

    "CLR", "SEL", "D0", 5V, and Gnd map to the following pins on the PCE port:

          Mini 8pin Din               Mini 8pin Din
        (controller end)             (Console Side)

          (6)  (7)    (8)             (8)  (7)    (6)
        (3)    (4)     (5)          (5)    (4)     (4)
            (1)    (2)                  (2)    (1)

          TG16 large Din
        (controller side)

            (7)   (6)
          (3)  (8)  (1)
            (5)   (4)
               (2) 

    *9th pin = outside ground sheild/connector.

    1 = +5V
    2 = D0
    3 = D1
    4 = D2
    5 = D3
    6 = SEL
    7 = CLR
    8 = GND
    9 = GND (shield)

    Note: The above does NOT represent the internal block pad connector to the controller PCB. Different pads have different arrangements for the PCB block connector.
          If you're using said donar cable with a block end, it would be very prudent to do a logic trace with a mult-meter first. 
          Don't assume order, which they are known to be different from region to region and pad to pad.
